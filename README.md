# thunderbolt

A hacking side-scroller where you have to use your wit to avoid security mechanisms in order to penetrate the security of computer systems.

# Game mechanics

Several possibilities:

- Game mechanics similar to mario bros where you don't have any weapons and you have to avoid being touched by enemies. This has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement.
- Implement "stealth-based" mechanics, where you need to rely on bypassing the eyesight of enemies to avoid detection.

# Story

This is the dark story of a programmer needs to resort to crime due to financial constraints. 

# Graphics

We can use mechanics of [this tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/2d-character-controllers "2d character controllers") as a placeholder while we develop our own mechanics, graphics and aesthetics.
